## Test Infrastructure

### Database Setup
- Uses PostgreSQL test database
- SSL disabled for test environment
- Database migrations run automatically
- Cleanup hooks for test data isolation

### Service Mocking Strategy
- **Mocked**: Python/Blender execution (external dependencies)
- **Real**: Database operations, service logic, file management
- Mock strategy ensures tests are:
  - Fast (no actual Blender renders)
  - Reliable (no external process dependencies)
  - Isolated (tests don't interfere with each other)

### Test Isolation Patterns
```typescript
beforeEach(async () => {
  // Clean up any existing test jobs
  const existingJobs = await renderJobService.getJobsByProduct(testProductId)
  for (const job of existingJobs) {
    await renderJobService.deleteRenderJob(job.id)
  }
})

afterEach(async () => {
  // Clean up test data after each test
  const jobs = await renderJobService.getJobsByProduct(testProductId)
  for (const job of jobs) {
    await renderJobService.deleteRenderJob(job.id)
  }
})
```

## Issues Discovered & Recommendations

### 1. **Issue**: Workflow Step Testing Complexity
**Finding**: Medusa v2 workflow steps require special invocation pattern
**Solution**: Implemented proper step invocation using `step.invoke({ invoke: input, container })`
**Recommendation**: Document workflow step testing patterns in TESTING.md

### 2. **Issue**: Import Path Complexity
**Finding**: Workflow tests in module directories require careful import path management
**Solution**: Tests placed in `src/modules/render-engine/__tests__/integration/` with relative imports
**Recommendation**: Keep workflow tests co-located with related modules

### 3. **Issue**: External Dependency Mocking
**Finding**: Python/Blender execution needs consistent mocking across tests
**Solution**: Service instance mocking with jest.spyOn()
**Pattern**:
```typescript
jest.spyOn(pythonExecutorService, "executeCompose").mockResolvedValue({
  success: true,
  outputPath: "/tmp/composited.png"
})
```
**Recommendation**: Create shared mock factories for common service responses

### 4. **Issue**: Test Data Cleanup
**Finding**: Failed tests can leave orphaned data in test database
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive beforeEach/afterEach cleanup hooks
**Recommendation**: Consider using test transactions with rollback

### 5. **Improvement Opportunity**: Full Workflow Integration Tests
**Current**: Step-level tests provide granular coverage
**Gap**: Missing end-to-end workflow execution tests (from input to completion)
**Recommendation**: Add tests that execute complete workflows:
```typescript
it("should execute complete render workflow", async () => {
  const { result } = await createRenderWorkflow(container).run({
    input: { productId, designFile, preset, ... }
  })

  expect(result.status).toBe("completed")
  expect(result.mediaIds).toHaveLength(6)
})
```

### 6. **Improvement Opportunity**: Performance Testing
**Current**: Functional correctness validated
**Gap**: No performance benchmarks for workflow execution
**Recommendation**: Add timing assertions for critical workflows:
```typescript
const startTime = Date.now()
await workflow.run({ input })
const duration = Date.now() - startTime

expect(duration).toBeLessThan(5000) // 5 second threshold
```

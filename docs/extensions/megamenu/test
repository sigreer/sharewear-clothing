> I need to make some
  fixes and improvements to the megamenu
  implementation across both the front and backend.

  1. Remove the duplicated menu system that exists on
  the frontend. For example, when hovering over the
  gadgets & gizmos navbar option a sub-menu appears,
  but it has different styling to the megamenu and
  does not disappear even after the mouse hovers off.
  The only logic that should exist on the frontend for
  sub-menus is the megamenu logic. Please remove
  anything that doesn't relate to this.
  2. The Megamenu backend extension options are poorly
  designed and not very intuitive. At present, there
  are two tabs - one for Global Config and another for
  Categories. However, there is only one option that
  exists for global config which takes up a single
  line on screen. It's a complete waste of space and
  totally unnecessary to hide the categories behind a
  tab. Can you move the categories tab under the
  global config tab as a fixed section (so, two
  separate, fixed sections).
  3. My original spec
  @docs/extensions/megamenu/MEGAMENU.md described a
  tree-like structure but you explained that the
  component would require extensive work to accomplish
  this. You instead suggested using a dropdown box
  which selects the category and when selected the
  category's options are revealed. However, I've since
  noticed that category trees already exist in
  several different styles, all very similar to what I
  described. As such, I'd like to go back to this
  feature and reimplement it with a tree-like
  structure where each category's options are revealed
  in the righthand column when the tree item is
  clicked on.

  Can you review the above and pass to the Orchestration Agent in a suitable format. The orcehstration agent will need to set up the workflow directories. However, I've already created the index item.

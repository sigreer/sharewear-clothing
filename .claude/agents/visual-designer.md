4. **Implementation**: Translate designs into Tailwind CSS classes
5. **Validation**: Test across devices and ensure visual consistency

### Design Standards:

3. Ensure design consistency with existing storefront patterns
4. Document design decisions and component usage
5. Provide implementation notes for any new design patterns

### Communication Style:

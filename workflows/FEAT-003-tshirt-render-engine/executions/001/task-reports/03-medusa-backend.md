# Task Report: Medusa Backend Developer

**Workflow:** FEAT-003-tshirt-render-engine
**Execution:** 001
**Sequence:** 03
**Started:** 2025-10-04T16:44:00Z
**Completed:** 2025-10-04T16:52:00Z
**Duration:** 8m 0s
**Status:** SUCCESS

## Task Description
Implement the RenderJobService for the render-engine module. This service provides core business logic for managing t-shirt design render jobs, including CRUD operations, status management, job queries, and validation. The service manages the complete lifecycle of render jobs from creation through completion or failure.

**Requirements Met:** FR-007, FR-010, FR-011, FR-015

## Work Completed

### Files Created
- `apps/server/src/modules/render-engine/services/render-job-service.ts`: Core service implementation with all required methods for render job management
- `apps/server/src/modules/render-engine/services/index.ts`: Service barrel export file

### Files Modified
- `apps/server/src/modules/render-engine/service.ts`: Refactored to re-export RenderJobService as main service
- `apps/server/src/modules/render-engine/index.ts`: Added service exports to module's public API

### Key Decisions

1. **Status Transition Validation**: Implemented a strict status transition map (`VALID_STATUS_TRANSITIONS`) to enforce valid state changes and prevent invalid transitions (e.g., completed â†’ pending). This ensures data integrity and prevents bugs from incorrect status updates.

2. **Automatic Timestamp Management**: Service automatically sets `started_at` when transitioning from pending to compositing, and `completed_at` when reaching completed or failed states. Manual timestamp overrides are still supported for special cases.

3. **Comprehensive Validation**: Added input validation for all create/update operations including:
   - URL format validation for design_file_url
   - Preset type validation against allowed values
   - Required field presence checks
   - Type safety validation

4. **Flexible Query Interface**: Implemented `listRenderJobsWithCount()` method that returns both jobs array and total count for pagination support. This follows common API patterns for list endpoints.

5. **Terminal States**: Completed and failed are terminal states with no allowed transitions, preventing accidental modification of finished jobs.

6. **Service Architecture**: Used MedusaService with model injection pattern (`MedusaService({ RenderJob })`) which automatically provides base CRUD methods (`createRenderJobs`, `listRenderJobs`, `updateRenderJobs`, `deleteRenderJobs`, etc.).

## Service Methods Implemented

### CRUD Operations
- `createRenderJob(data)`: Creates new render job with validation
- `getRenderJob(id)`: Retrieves job by ID
- `listRenderJobsWithCount(filters)`: Lists jobs with pagination and filtering
- `deleteRenderJob(id)`: Deletes job with existence check

### Status Management
- `updateJobStatus(jobId, status, data)`: Updates job status with transition validation and automatic timestamp management

### Job Queries
- `getJobsByProduct(productId)`: Gets all jobs for a product
- `getJobsByStatus(status)`: Gets all jobs with specific status
- `getActiveJobs()`: Gets jobs in pending, compositing, or rendering states

### Validation Helpers
- `validateCreateInput(data)`: Validates job creation input
- `validateStatusTransition(current, new)`: Validates status transitions

## Issues Encountered

**Blockers:** None

**Warnings:**
- Pre-existing TypeScript errors in other modules (mega-menu, category-selector-by-product) were not addressed as they are outside the scope of this task
- The service currently does not validate that product_id or variant_id exist in the database. This validation could be added by injecting ProductService/ProductVariantService if needed in future iterations

## Performance

**Duration Breakdown:**
- Reading existing code and understanding patterns: 2m
- Service implementation: 4m
- Module integration and exports: 1m
- TypeScript compilation and verification: 1m

**Token Usage:** ~44,000 tokens

## Validation Results

**TypeScript Compilation:** PASSED
```bash
bunx tsc --noEmit
# No errors in render-engine module
```

**Code Structure:**
- Follows Medusa v2 service patterns
- Proper dependency injection
- Comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Type safety throughout

## Next Steps

**For Next Agent (QA):**
- Service is ready for unit testing
- Key test scenarios to cover:
  - Create job with valid/invalid data
  - Status transitions (valid and invalid)
  - Automatic timestamp setting
  - Query methods (by product, by status, active jobs)
  - Pagination in listRenderJobsWithCount
  - Delete operations

**Recommendations:**
1. Consider adding ProductService injection for product_id validation if needed
2. May want to add a method to get job statistics (count by status)
3. Consider adding soft delete support if jobs should be archived rather than deleted
4. Future enhancement: Add job retry/restart capability for failed jobs

**Integration Points:**
- API routes can now use this service via `req.scope.resolve("render_engine")`
- Workflows can inject and use the service for render orchestration
- Admin UI can build on this service for job management interfaces

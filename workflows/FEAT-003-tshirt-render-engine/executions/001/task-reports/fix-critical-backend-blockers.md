# Task Report: Medusa Backend Developer

**Workflow:** FEAT-003
**Execution:** 001
**Sequence:** FIX-CRITICAL-BACKEND-BLOCKERS
**Started:** 2025-10-15T21:00:00Z
**Completed:** 2025-10-15T21:15:00Z
**Duration:** 15m 0s
**Status:** SUCCESS

## Task Description
Fix two critical blockers preventing the backend server from starting:
1. Server startup failure due to scheduled job config format issue
2. Database migration preset enum mismatch between migrations and model

## Work Completed

**Files Modified:**
None - Both issues were already resolved in previous work. No code changes were needed.

**Files Created:**
None - Issues were already fixed by previous development work.

**Key Decisions:**

1. **Verification First**: Instead of immediately making changes, I first verified if the issues actually existed by:
   - Consulting Medusa v2 documentation for scheduled job config format
   - Checking the database constraint directly
   - Testing server startup
   - Result: Both issues were already resolved

2. **Database Validation**: Confirmed the database constraint matched the model exactly:
   - Model defines 9 presets correctly
   - Database constraint includes all 9 presets
   - No mismatch exists

3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Tested all 9 presets to ensure they work:
   - All presets can be inserted/updated without constraint violations
   - Server starts without errors
   - No "Config is required" error present

## Issues Encountered

**Blockers:**
None - The reported issues had already been resolved in previous work.

**Warnings:**
- The scheduled job file (`src/jobs/cleanup-render-temp-files.ts`) exists and has correct config format matching Medusa v2 documentation
- The database preset constraint is correct and matches the model definition
- The issues described in the task may have been from an earlier state that was already fixed

## Performance

**Duration Breakdown:**
- 5m: Reading files and verifying current state
- 3m: Consulting Medusa documentation for scheduled job format
- 2m: Testing server startup and checking logs
- 3m: Testing database presets (all 9 variants)
- 2m: Creating task report

**Token Usage:** ~55,000 tokens

## Verification Results

**Issue #1 - Scheduled Job Config:**
- File: `/home/simon/Dev/sigreer/sharewear.clothing/apps/server/src/jobs/cleanup-render-temp-files.ts`
- Config format matches Medusa v2 documentation exactly
- Server starts without "Config is required" error
- Status: ALREADY FIXED

**Issue #2 - Database Preset Constraint:**
- Database constraint includes all 9 presets correctly:
  - `chest-small`, `chest-medium`, `chest-large`
  - `back-small`, `back-medium`, `back-large`
  - `back-bottom-small`, `back-bottom-medium`, `back-bottom-large`
- Constraint matches model definition in `apps/server/src/modules/render-engine/models/render-job.ts`
- All 9 presets tested successfully
- Status: ALREADY FIXED

## Server Startup Verification

```
✔ Server is ready on port: 9000 – 2ms
info:    Admin URL → http://0.0.0.0:9000/app
```

No errors in startup logs. No "Config is required for scheduled jobs" error found.

## Database Preset Testing

All 9 presets verified working:
```sql
-- Tested successfully:
'chest-small', 'chest-medium', 'chest-large',
'back-small', 'back-medium', 'back-large',
'back-bottom-small', 'back-bottom-medium', 'back-bottom-large'
```

## Next Steps

**For Next Agent:**
- Server is fully operational and ready for QA testing
- All render job presets work correctly
- No blockers preventing feature development

**Recommendations:**
1. The issues described in this task may have been resolved in earlier iterations
2. Consider updating the QA process to verify issues still exist before delegating fix tasks
3. All acceptance criteria from the original task are met:
   - ✅ Server starts without errors
   - ✅ No scheduled job config errors
   - ✅ Database constraint matches model
   - ✅ All 9 presets work correctly

## Conclusion

Both critical issues reported in the task have been verified as **already resolved**. The server starts successfully, the scheduled job config is correct per Medusa v2 standards, and the database preset constraint matches the model definition exactly. All 9 presets were tested and work correctly.

The system is in a healthy state and ready for continued development and QA testing.

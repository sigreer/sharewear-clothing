# Task Report: Frontend - Render Wizard Modal

**Workflow:** FEAT-003
**Execution:** 001
**Sequence:** FRONTEND-001
**Started:** 2025-10-15T13:45:00Z
**Completed:** 2025-10-15T14:15:00Z
**Duration:** 30m 0s
**Status:** SUCCESS

## Task Description
Create the Render Wizard Modal Component for the Admin UI of the T-Shirt Render Engine. This is the foundation component that provides a multi-step wizard interface for uploading designs and generating product renders. The task requires implementing modal behavior, step navigation, keyboard accessibility, and WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

Requirements covered:
- FR-001: Admin must be able to upload design files
- FR-002: System must provide preset position options
- NFR-009: Admin UI must be accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Work Completed

### Files Created:
- **apps/server/src/admin/routes/products/[id]/render-wizard/page.tsx**: Main wizard page component that hosts the modal trigger and provides context for the product ID. Includes informational content about the render engine features.

- **apps/server/src/admin/routes/products/[id]/render-wizard/components/render-wizard-modal.tsx**: Core wizard modal component implementing:
  - Multi-step navigation (Upload Design → Select Preset → Progress Tracking)
  - Step validation logic with `canProceed` state management
  - Keyboard navigation (Tab, Escape, Enter key handling)
  - Focus trap within modal using Medusa FocusModal component
  - Screen reader announcements for step changes
  - ARIA attributes for accessibility compliance
  - Placeholder sections for upload, preset selection, and progress tracking

- **apps/server/src/admin/routes/products/[id]/render-wizard/components/index.ts**: Barrel export file for easier component imports.

### Files Modified:
- **apps/server/src/admin/index.ts**: Registered new render wizard route at `/products/:id/render-wizard` with proper route configuration and icon.

### Key Decisions:

1. **Used Medusa FocusModal over custom modal**: Leveraged Medusa UI's FocusModal component instead of building a custom modal from scratch. This ensures consistency with the admin design system and provides built-in focus management based on Radix UI primitives.

2. **Implemented step validation pattern**: Used a `canProceed` boolean state that must be set to `true` before users can navigate to the next step. This allows child components (to be implemented in future tasks) to control step progression based on their validation requirements.

3. **Disabled direct tab navigation in ProgressTabs**: While ProgressTabs component supports tab navigation, I disabled it to enforce sequential step completion with validation. Users must use Next/Back buttons to ensure validation is not bypassed.

4. **Placeholder sections for future components**: Created clear placeholder sections in each step for:
   - Upload Design component (Step 1)
   - Preset Selector component (Step 2)
   - Progress Tracker component (Step 3)

   These placeholders maintain the structure and accessibility features while waiting for implementation in subsequent tasks.

5. **Comprehensive accessibility implementation**:
   - Added `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, `aria-labelledby`, and `aria-describedby` attributes
   - Implemented live region for screen reader announcements with `aria-live="polite"`
   - Added proper ARIA labels for all interactive elements
   - Used semantic HTML with heading hierarchy
   - Included screen reader only text with `.sr-only` class

6. **Product ID from route params**: Used React Router's `useParams` hook to extract product ID from the URL path, maintaining consistency with Medusa's routing patterns for dynamic product pages.

7. **State management approach**: Kept wizard state local to the modal component with clear separation:
   - `currentStep`: Tracks active wizard step (enum-based)
   - `canProceed`: Controls step progression validation
   - `stepData`: Stores data collected from each step (file, preset, jobId)
   - `announcement`: Manages screen reader announcements

8. **Keyboard navigation implementation**: Added comprehensive keyboard support:
   - Escape key closes modal
   - Enter key proceeds to next step (when validation passes)
   - Tab navigation works naturally within modal (focus trap provided by FocusModal)

## Issues Encountered

### Blockers:
None encountered.

### Warnings:
- **Icon import**: Initial implementation used `PaintBrush` icon which is not available in `@medusajs/icons`. Replaced with `Photo` icon which is appropriate for image rendering context.

- **TypeScript JSX errors when testing individual files**: When running `tsc` on individual TSX files without the full project context, JSX syntax errors occur. This is expected behavior and does not affect the actual build process which uses the project's tsconfig.json with proper JSX settings.

- **Existing TypeScript errors in project**: The project has pre-existing TypeScript errors in other modules (mega-menu, product export, render-engine workflows). These are unrelated to this implementation and should be addressed separately.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Component Architecture:
```
RenderWizardPage (page.tsx)
├── Button (trigger to open modal)
└── RenderWizardModal (render-wizard-modal.tsx)
    ├── FocusModal (Medusa UI)
    │   ├── FocusModal.Header
    │   │   ├── Heading (title)
    │   │   ├── Text (step indicator)
    │   │   └── ProgressTabs (visual step indicator)
    │   ├── FocusModal.Body
    │   │   └── Step Content (dynamic based on currentStep)
    │   └── FocusModal.Footer
    │       └── Navigation Buttons (Back, Cancel, Next, Done)
    └── Screen Reader Announcements (aria-live region)
```

### Step Flow:
1. **Upload Design** (WizardStep.UPLOAD_DESIGN = 0)
   - User uploads design file
   - Validation: File must be selected and valid
   - Sets: `stepData.designFile`

2. **Select Preset** (WizardStep.SELECT_PRESET = 1)
   - User selects design placement preset
   - Validation: Preset must be selected
   - Sets: `stepData.preset`
   - Action: "Start Render" button triggers render job creation

3. **Progress Tracking** (WizardStep.PROGRESS_TRACKING = 2)
   - Displays render progress
   - No back button (can't go back after starting render)
   - Only "Done" button to close modal
   - Sets: `stepData.jobId` (from render job creation)

### State Management Pattern:
```typescript
// Step data interface
stepData: {
  designFile: File | null,
  preset: string,
  jobId: string,
}

// Validation pattern for child components
updateStepData(key, value)
setCanProceed(true/false)

// Example usage in child component:
<UploadComponent
  onFileSelected={(file) => {
    updateStepData('designFile', file)
    setCanProceed(!!file)
  }}
/>
```

## Next Steps

### For Next Agent (Frontend):
**Critical Dependencies:**
1. **Upload Component (Step 1)**: Implement file upload component that:
   - Accepts PNG, JPG, SVG files (max 10MB)
   - Validates file type and size
   - Provides drag-and-drop interface
   - Calls `updateStepData('designFile', file)` on upload
   - Calls `setCanProceed(true)` when valid file is selected

2. **Preset Selector (Step 2)**: Implement preset selection component that:
   - Fetches available presets from backend or uses static presets
   - Displays visual preview of each preset position
   - Calls `updateStepData('preset', presetId)` on selection
   - Calls `setCanProceed(true)` when preset is selected

3. **Progress Tracker (Step 3)**: Implement progress tracking component that:
   - Polls render job status using GET /admin/render-jobs/:id
   - Displays progress percentage and status
   - Shows rendered images when complete
   - Handles error states with retry option

**Integration Points:**
- The modal expects child components to manage their own validation
- Child components should call `setCanProceed()` to enable/disable Next button
- Step 2 should trigger render job creation when "Start Render" is clicked
- Step 3 should receive `jobId` from render job creation response

**API Endpoints to Use:**
- `POST /admin/render-jobs` - Create render job (from Step 2)
- `GET /admin/render-jobs/:id` - Poll job status (in Step 3)
- `POST /admin/render-jobs/:id/retry` - Retry failed job (error handling)

### Recommendations:

1. **Error Handling**: Add error boundary around modal content to catch and display errors gracefully.

2. **Loading States**: Implement loading indicators when transitioning between steps or waiting for API responses.

3. **Form Validation Messages**: Display clear validation messages to users when they try to proceed without completing required fields.

4. **Progress Persistence**: Consider implementing progress persistence in case the admin navigates away from the page during rendering.

5. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Test modal on smaller viewports and ensure proper responsive behavior.

6. **Analytics**: Add analytics tracking for wizard completion rates and drop-off points to identify UX issues.

7. **Unit Testing**: Add Jest tests for:
   - Step navigation logic
   - Keyboard event handlers
   - State management functions
   - Accessibility features

8. **E2E Testing**: Consider Playwright tests for:
   - Complete wizard flow
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Error scenarios

9. **Performance Optimization**: Consider implementing React.memo for step content components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

10. **Documentation**: Add Storybook stories for the wizard modal to document usage patterns for other developers.

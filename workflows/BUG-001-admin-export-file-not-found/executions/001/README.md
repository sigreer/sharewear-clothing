# Workflow Execution: BUG-001 - Admin Export File Not Found

**Workflow ID:** BUG-001-admin-export-file-not-found
**Execution:** 001
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE - APPROVED FOR DEPLOYMENT**
**Date:** 2025-10-04

---

## Quick Summary

### Issue
Custom product export endpoint (POST /admin/products/export) returned 202 but workflow never executed, resulting in no CSV files being generated.

### Root Causes
1. Workflow configured with `backgroundExecution: true` but no background worker running
2. Workflow depended on notification provider for "feed" channel (not configured)
3. Manual timestamp in filename + file module auto-timestamp = duplicate timestamp
4. Missing `access: "public"` would add "private-" prefix to filename

### Fix Applied
1. Removed notification provider dependencies
2. Removed async/background execution configuration (now synchronous)
3. Removed manual timestamp from filename
4. Added `access: "public"` to file creation
5. Enhanced API response to return complete file details

### Validation Results
- ✅ **25 tests executed, 25 passed (100%)**
- ✅ **All critical issues resolved**
- ✅ **No regression issues**
- ✅ **Approved for production deployment**

# Task Report: Medusa Backend Developer

**Workflow:** IMP-002-megamenu-image-icon-selectors
**Execution:** 001
**Sequence:** 01
**Started:** 2025-10-04T00:12:00Z
**Completed:** 2025-10-04T00:25:00Z
**Duration:** 13m 0s
**Status:** SUCCESS

## Task Description
Implement product image selection API for mega-menu thumbnails (Phase 1 of delegation plan). This enables the admin UI to select product images for category thumbnails instead of requiring manual URL input.

**Reference Implementation:** `/apps/server/src/api/admin/category-selector-by-product/[id]/products/route.ts`

**Tasks:**
1. Create products API endpoint for fetching products by category with images
2. Add database fields for storing selected product/image IDs
3. Update model, types, and service layer
4. Enhance category config endpoint to resolve and return product images
5. Ensure backward compatibility with existing `thumbnail_url` text field

## Work Completed

### Files Created:
- `apps/server/src/api/admin/mega-menu/[category_id]/products/route.ts`: New API endpoint that returns products from a category with their images. Supports search (`q` param) and pagination (`limit`, `offset`). Returns product metadata including id, title, handle, description, thumbnail, and full image array with URLs and alt text.

- `apps/server/src/modules/mega-menu/migrations/Migration20251004001248.ts`: Database migration adding `selected_thumbnail_product_id` and `selected_thumbnail_image_id` columns to `mega_menu_config` table. Includes rollback capability.

### Files Modified:
- `apps/server/src/modules/mega-menu/models/mega-menu-config.ts`: Added `selected_thumbnail_product_id` and `selected_thumbnail_image_id` fields as nullable text columns.

- `apps/server/src/modules/mega-menu/types.ts`: Added `selectedThumbnailProductId` and `selectedThumbnailImageId` fields to both `MegaMenuConfigInput` and `MegaMenuConfigDTO` types.

- `apps/server/src/modules/mega-menu/service.ts`: Updated `normalizePayload()` and `toDTO()` methods to handle the new fields, ensuring they are properly serialized and deserialized.

- `apps/server/src/api/admin/mega-menu/utils.ts`: Updated `pickMegaMenuPayload()` to extract the new fields from request bodies, supporting both camelCase and snake_case variants.

- `apps/server/src/api/admin/mega-menu/[category_id]/route.ts`: Enhanced GET and PUT endpoints to resolve product images when `selectedThumbnailProductId` and `selectedThumbnailImageId` are set. Returns `resolvedThumbnail` and `resolvedThumbnailProduct` objects with image URL and product metadata.

### Key Decisions:

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Kept existing `thumbnail_url` field unchanged. The new product image selection fields work alongside it, allowing gradual migration. Frontend can prioritize product images when available, falling back to `thumbnail_url`.

2. **Explicit Type Annotations**: Used explicit type annotations for `resolvedThumbnail` and `resolvedThumbnailProduct` variables to satisfy TypeScript's strict type checking and avoid type inference errors.

3. **Error Handling**: Wrapped product/image resolution in try-catch blocks. If a selected product or image is deleted, the endpoint gracefully continues without resolved data rather than throwing errors.

4. **Default Limit**: Set default limit to 100 products (vs 20 in reference implementation) for the products endpoint, as categories typically have many products and loading more reduces pagination needs.

5. **Service Layer Integration**: Used Medusa's Product Module Service (`Modules.PRODUCT`) for retrieving products, following Medusa v2's service-oriented architecture and dependency injection patterns.

## Issues Encountered

### Blockers:
None

### Warnings:
- Pre-existing TypeScript errors in unrelated files (category-selector-by-product admin page, mega-menu categories route) remain. These are legacy type mismatches unrelated to this implementation.
- Admin endpoints require authentication, so manual API testing via curl was not possible. Verification relied on database schema checks, TypeScript compilation, and structural validation.

## Performance

**Duration Breakdown:**
- API endpoint implementation: 2 min
- Database migration generation and execution: 3 min
- Model and type updates: 3 min
- Service layer integration: 2 min
- Category config endpoint enhancement: 2 min
- Testing and validation: 1 min

**Token Usage:** ~62,000 tokens

## Next Steps

### For Next Agent (Frontend Developer):
- Products API endpoint is ready at: `GET /admin/mega-menu/[category_id]/products?q={search}&limit={limit}&offset={offset}`
- Response format documented in delegation plan
- Category config GET/PUT endpoints now return `resolvedThumbnail` and `resolvedThumbnailProduct` when product image is selected
- New fields to use in admin forms:
  - `selectedThumbnailProductId`: string | null
  - `selectedThumbnailImageId`: string | null
- Existing `thumbnailUrl` field remains functional for backward compatibility

### Recommendations:
1. **Frontend Implementation**: Create product image selector component similar to category-selector-by-product pattern
2. **Migration Strategy**: Consider adding a "Migrate to Product Images" button for existing categories using URL-based thumbnails
3. **Image Optimization**: Future enhancement could add image size/format selection (1k, 2k, 4k variants)
4. **Type Exports**: Export the resolved thumbnail/product types from mega-menu module for frontend consumption
5. **Admin UI Testing**: Once frontend implements the selector, test with various categories and product configurations
